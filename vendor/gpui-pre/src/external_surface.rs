//! External surfaces on Linux (an ngterm patch): frames produced outside GPUI that the renderer draws through
//! [`crate::Window::paint_external_surface`], the Linux counterpart of macOS's `paint_surface`.
//!
//! A frame is either a dmabuf ([`DmaBufFrame`]), which the renderer imports into its own device (no CPU copy: the GPU
//! takes the buffer over from the producer's foreign queue family and copies the frame into a texture of its own), or
//! CPU pixels ([`PixelFrame`]), uploaded by damaged rectangle into a texture the renderer keeps per [`PixelSurface`].
//! Every frame reports once how it ended ([`FrameOutcome`]): `Presented` only after the GPU finished the submission
//! that copied or first drew it, so a producer that reuses a buffer on that report never races the renderer's reads.
//!
//! A dmabuf is imported once per [`DmaBuffer`] and kept while the producer keeps the buffer: the renderer holds only a
//! weak reference, so the import goes once the producer dropped its last `Arc` (when the buffer leaves its set) and
//! the GPU is done with it. [`dmabuf_import_caps`] says what the renderer's device imports, for a producer to allocate
//! on that device in formats it can import.
